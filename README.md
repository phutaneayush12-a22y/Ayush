Sensory Comfort Toolkit for Autistic Children
Overview

The Sensory Comfort Toolkit is a Python-based assistive tool designed to provide personalized calming and stimulation support for autistic children. It focuses on reducing sensory overload by offering parent-approved calming options like soothing music, visual animations, breathing guides, and more.

This project aims to create a safe, predictable, and inclusive environment for autistic children to self-regulate emotions while giving parents complete control over personalization.
